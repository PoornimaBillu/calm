        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <h4>How much sleep do i need..?</h4>
        <p>While the recommended amount of sleep for adults is generally 7 to 9 hours per night, individual requirements can vary person to person, depending on factors such as age, lifestyle, and genetics. Pay attention to your body's signals, strive for consistency in your sleep routine to help regulate your body's internal clock, and prioritize both sleep duration and quality.</p>
    <h4>Why can't I sleep?</h4>
    <p>There can be various reasons why you may be experiencing trouble sleeping.

Here are a few common factors that can contribute to sleep difficulties:

Stress and Anxiety: High levels of stress or anxiety can make it difficult to relax and fall asleep. Racing thoughts, worry, or an overactive mind can keep you awake at night.
Poor Sleep Habits: Irregular sleep patterns, inconsistent bedtime routines, excessive caffeine or alcohol consumption, and engaging in stimulating activities before bed can disrupt your sleep.
Environmental Factors: Uncomfortable sleeping environment, excessive noise, extreme temperatures, or inadequate lighting can interfere with your ability to fall asleep or stay asleep.
Medical Conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as chronic pain, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or hormonal imbalances can disrupt your sleep.
Mental Health Issues: Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mental health challenges can affect sleep patterns and quality.
If you're consistently having trouble sleeping, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional who can help assess your specific situation and provide guidance that's tailored to your needs.</p>
    

        <h4>How can I sleep better?</h4>
        <p>WWe recommend starting with our Fall Asleep collection in the Calm app, which features our most popular Sleep Stories®, soundscapes, music, and meditations based on your goals:

Help falling asleep: natural sleep aids
Getting back to sleep: reactive tools used to soothe you back to sleep
Unwinding before bed: proactive tools to help start a sleep routine, focused on sleep hygiene - this means building habits and an environment for optimal sleep
You may have already heard of our most popular sleep offering, Sleep Stories®, which are bedtime stories designed to help you drift off to sleep. Many of our narrators are names you may already be familiar with, from artists like Harry Styles and Michael Bublé to actors and actresses such as Jennifer Garner and Matthew McConaughey. Kids can also enjoy exclusive Sleep Stories® featuring favorite characters such as Peppa Pig, Minions, Winnie the Pooh, Transformers, and more.

We also have soothing soundscapes and music that have been sonically-engineered to help you sleep. Choose from nature sounds such as rainstorms and ocean waves, to different frequency pitches including white, brown, and green noise. If you're looking for something that provides a bit more guidance, there's a variety of sleep meditations and breathwork. These exercises help lower the heart rate, which shifts your nervous system out of fight or flight and into a relaxed parasympathetic mode, enabling your body to fall into a deeper sleep.

Lastly, we also have a Sleep Check-In feature which offers a new way to track your sleep. Check in with your nightly sleep quality, and we'll show you patterns to guide you towards better sleep habits and health..</p>
