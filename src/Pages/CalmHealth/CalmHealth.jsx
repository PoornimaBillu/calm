        <h4>Easily screen your populations for anxiety and depression</h4>
        <p>In a historic move acknowledging the nation's mental health crisis, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued draft recommendations that adults under 65 be screened for anxiety.

Our dynamic assessment allows members to self-screen for anxiety and depression using validated GAD-7 and PHQ-9 question sets, with consumer-friendly results and recommended paths forward.</p>
